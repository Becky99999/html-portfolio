<h1>A quick introduction about me</h1>

<p>Hello developers!
  My name is Rebeka and I finally got the opportunity to start learning about web development.
  So here are a few things about me. I have completed my Master of Spanish and Latin Filology at 
  University of Zadar. I'm currently working for a translation company in Spain. 
  When I'm not working, I spend my time in fulfilling pursuits such as rollerblading, reading and
  playing board games. 
  I enjoy connecting with people who have the same passion for technology as I do and I'm open to 
  interesting work offers abroad once I finish my programming course.
